# STM32F407-program-to-extract-and-store-data-from-STM32F103-board
This project extracts and stores data from an STM32F103 board connected to an STM32F407 board via USB. The program uses the STM32F407 board as the USB host to read data from the STM32F103 board and store it in a file on a USB flash drive.
